### Home
When the BIRCH web-app initially loads, the home tab is displayed at first. The home tab just contains details on what BIRCH is and the workflow followed in BIRCH to go from data affected by batch-effect to batch-corrected data.

### Settings
From the home tab, you can navigate to the settings tab to set input parameters for batch correction. For this example, we will use a dummy dataset to demonstrate the entire process and make note of the things to look out for while dealing with your own data.
